This repository contains two excel sheets as well as my Preparing Data for Analysis with Microsoft Excel certification. One of the excel sheets is before my formatting and modifications and one after.
In this project I've:
- Altered the formatting of the worksheet
- Modified its appearance to prepare it for presentation
- Used formulas, including logical and percentage formulas, to create an executive summary    for the Quarter One performance for these products.
